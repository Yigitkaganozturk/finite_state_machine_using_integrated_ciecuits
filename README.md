# finite_state_machine_using_integrated_ciecuits
Aim of this lab is to learn how to design and implement finite state machines. It is required to design a finite state machine and indicate its state diagram and output tables. Then the FSM design implemented on the breadboard using integrated circuits to implement digital circuit components..
